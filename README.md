# .dotfiles

**Warning**: Donâ€™t blindly use my settings unless you know what you are doing. Use at your own risk!

I use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles.

```bash
brew install stow
```

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toriphes/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles
stow */
```
